2. Set environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

## Product Vision

**Problem:** SMBs spend 10+ hours researching compliance requirements across jurisdictions. Legal consultation costs $1500+.

**Solution:** AI assistant that understands your business, searches authoritative sources, and delivers actionable compliance intelligence in under 5 minutes.

**Impact:** 95% time reduction, $0 upfront cost, real-time regulatory data.



## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Input
Users describe their business naturally—no forms, no legal jargon.
```
"We're building expense management software for EU B2B clients..."
```

### 2. Intelligent Search
GPT-4 autonomously decides search strategy, validates sources, and prioritizes official government sites.

### 3. Regulation Timeline
Results organized by date with impact assessment (High/Medium/Low) and actionable requirements.

### 4. Enterprise Security
Prompt injection protection, rate limiting, input validation, and audit logging.
